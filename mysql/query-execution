1. The client sends the SQL statement to the server.

2. The server checks the query cache. If thereâ€™s a hit, it returns the stored result from
the cache; otherwise, it passes the SQL statement to the next step.

3. The server parses, preprocesses, and optimizes the SQL into a query execution
plan.

4. The query execution engine executes the plan by making calls to the storage engine
API.

5. The server sends the result to the client.
